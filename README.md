- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Natural Idiot
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, as well as competitive gaming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, as I've learnt it before, but forgot most of it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can DM me on discord. My username is .naturalidiot

A little more info:
  I tend to play BeatSaber the most, as I'm ranked 7k in the world and 3k in the US, but I've been playing Gorilla Tag a bit more often, since I want to be on the competitve side of it :). I also play Geometry Dash, but I mainly make layouts, I don't play levels as much. I know multiple coding languages, including Java Script, C#, C++, and HTML.
I don't count visual coding, such as Scratch and UE4/UE5 blueprints, but I still use them to make stuff :)
